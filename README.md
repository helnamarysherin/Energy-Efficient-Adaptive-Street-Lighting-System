# Energy-Efficient-Adaptive-Street-Lighting-System

## 📌 Overview
An Arduino-based adaptive street lighting system that uses an LDR to monitor ambient light and control LED brightness through PWM. The system minimizes energy consumption while ensuring optimal illumination, making it suitable for smart city and sustainable infrastructure applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Reduce energy wastage in street lighting
- Automatically adjust brightness based on ambient light
- Demonstrate PWM-based LED control
- Support smart city and sustainable infrastructure concepts

---

## ⚙️ System Working
- The LDR continuously monitors surrounding light levels.
- Arduino processes the sensor data in real time.
- LED brightness is adjusted using PWM:
  - Low ambient light → higher brightness
  - High ambient light → reduced brightness
- This ensures energy-efficient operation.
